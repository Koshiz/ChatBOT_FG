CCMPs offer a structured and robust approach to data analytics. Financial projections are more accurate when a company has more precise data analysis processes. Scaling up is a very good thing, but it often comes with an urgent need for formalizing data collection and KPI assessment. These tasks can also be time-consuming and require great attention to detail. A cultivation team can optimize their time and data entry methods by switching to a software program that fully supports operational growth. A CCMP helps you strategize and design methods of data collection rather than taking a rushed, haphazard approach to reporting. A CCMP can help balance the demands of meeting real-time METRC reporting responsibilities and in-person operational needs.
House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program allows people with certain medical conditions to purchase and use medical marijuana. In order to qualify, the person must have the recommendation of an Ohio-licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board.

METRC Benefits
Metrc is a hosted, real-time system that uses serialized tags with bar-code, human-readable and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags attached to every plant, and labels attached to wholesale packages to track marijuana inventory. Each tag is attached to a plant to facilitate tracking through different stages of growth, as well as the drying and curing processes.

Data integrity means less risk of compliance problems. In a high-risk industry, taking precautions and the following policy is crucial. Plant traceability is important for promoting customer safety and legal market activity.

Metrcâs goal from the start was to create a robust track-and-trace platform to facilitate data collection on a massive scale.
The main benefit of METRC is consumer safety. If a product has an unfavorable event, such as making someone ill, the incident can be tracked back to the specific plant group. Product associated with the specific plant or package tag can be pulled from shelves. This gives your marijuana consumers reassurance that if something goes wrong, the marijuana tracking software will track it and almost immediately ensure restored safety in the cannabis market. METRC cannabis is safer cannabis. A secondary benefit is that the METRC cannabis tracking system makes it more difficult to produce marijuana illegally or to cheat on reporting the entire inventory.

What is METRC, and what does METRC stand for? METRC stands for Marijuana Enforcement Tracking and Compliance. It provides a marijuana tracking and reporting system to support the enforcement of regulations related to the legalization, production, and distribution of cannabis. METRC follows marijuana from when the seed sprouts to when the final sale is made, âseed to sale.â This is also called end to end tracking.

The METRC system relies on RFID tags. RFID means radio frequency identification and refers to the scannable code on the tag, which can be read with an RFID reader. The code is similar to barcodes and may be even be referred to as a barcode, although it does offer a distinct technology that not all barcodes have. These RFID tags are attached to plants, which allows for dynamic tracking of a specific plant throughout the growing, testing, and harvesting process. When product is packaged, a package tag is applied, which provides a unique identifier for that group of packaged plants as they are shipped and sold.

Next, letâs explore what Metrc does and what it tracks. Basically, Metrc focuses on reporting, tracking, and compliance. They primarily track three things. To start, they track what you have on hand. After that, they track how much you have. And, finally, they track where it is in your facility. In addition, Metrc tracks the custody of plants and cannabis products produced or held by a licensed entity. Metrc also tracks all external transfers of plants and products between licensees. Finally, Metrc reports lab testing results for all finished cannabis products that will be sold in a dispensary.

METRC charges a monthly fee, currently $40. This covers the license to use their program and ongoing training and support. There is a separate cost per tag for the RFID plant and package tracking tags. However, you do not have to purchase any software to participate in METRC tracking and reporting; the entire system is cloud-based. This is especially helpful if you are managing growing facility in multiple states. You could be based in Ohio and still enter or follow up on date for METRC Michigan or METRC Montana. And with the increasing popularity of METRCâs system and increasing legalization of marijuana, growing cannabis cultivation businesses will increasingly need to communicate across state regulatory lines.

Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting Compliance (METRC). METRC is a web-based reporting and compliance system that
Maine is one of 15 states that mandate use of METRC, and an increasing number of states are also mandating METRC seed-to-sale tracking system use. In many states cannabis businesses can use any “in-house” record-keeping they would like, but more states are transitioning to software customized to capture cannabis cultivation cycles and data analysis.
While this also increases the safety for legal buyers by keeping all legally sold cannabis tracked in the system, it also helps ensure that the government receives the correct amount of taxation from marijuana sales. Just as Nevadaâs gaming regulators are going to make sure that slot machine excise taxes are paid, Nevada METRC is going to help the state collect all the taxes due on marijuana cultivation and sales.
AB 533 also established the Cannabis Advisory Commission (CAC) which serves to study cannabis-related issues and make recommendations to the CCB. The CAC consists of 12-members, eight of which are appointed by the governor, representing relevant state agencies and members of the cannabis industry and the public. Recommendations from the CAC do not bind the CCB but provide information to assist the CCB with its decision-making.

Over a dozen states and the District of Columbia rely on METRC and require cannabis suppliers to comply. All participating states require marijuana growers and distributing businesses to receive METRC training and METRC certification. But since each state has specific rules to follow, METRC adapts to each state in its tracking and reporting processes. Systems for METRC California, where marijuana is completely legal, and METRC Maryland, which only tracks medical marijuana, will not have exactly the same requirements and needs. And some states have specific marijuana licensing authorities, while others, such as Oregon, place the cannabis compliance responsibility under the liquor control commission.

METRC Colorado Overview:
You may be wondering how Metrc works. First, cannabis producers (growers) purchase plant and package tags in the states where Metrc is required for seed-to-sale tracking. The growers buy the tags through the Metrc platform. Afterward, the tags are embedded with barcodes and RFID technology. As a result, regulatory bodies ensure that plants and products are not illegally diverted to the black market. In summary, the Metrc system tracks and registers every plant, batch, harvest, and cannabis product.

In addition to the plant or package tagâs ID, the tags will also have your facility name and license number and the tag order date.
